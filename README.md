# DNSPerfTest
DNSPerfTest was intended to get a complete toolsuite for testing performance of nameserver infrastructure.

Unfortunately I don't have any time to put further work in this project.
Therefore I seperated the finished parts of it in two new projects:

- updpingpong: https://github.com/pfedick/udppingpong
  Tools for measuring udp throughput
  
- dnspecker: https://github.com/pfedick/dnspecker
  Tool for testing performance of nameserver
